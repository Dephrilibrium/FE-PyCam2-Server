# FE-PyCam2

That projects represents a python-netsocket (server) to manage a Raspberry Pi HQ-Camera based on libcamera (picamera2) as scientific imaging sensor for the measurement of field emission electron sources.

# README.md ToDo:
- Complete the setup-description
- Insert links for faster access to the necessary tools/programs
- Cloning into current directory works with `git clone <Repo-Link> .` or `git clone <Repo-Link> ./`


# Setup
Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB); Should also work on models with less than 8GB RAM
The project should run also on a Pi3 (depends only on libcamera and therefore on debian 11 bullseye), but that's not tested
## OS-Setup
OS: Raspbian OS Lite 64bit (based on debian 11 bullseye for native libcamera-supportc)
Download the image from the raspberry pi homepage manually and flash via an imager of your choise or use the pi imager directly to set up the sd-card.
